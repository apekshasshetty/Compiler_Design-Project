"# Compiler_Design-Project" 
This project focuses on designing a Lexer and Parser for a simple hypothetical language. These components are essential parts of the Analysis phase in the compilation process, responsible for
identifying tokens within a given program and verifying their syntactic correctness based on predefined production rules. The main program requires two inputs: the source program to be processed and the grammar rules used for parsing. The goal of the project is to generate a parsed sequence that can be utilized in subsequent stages of the compiler.
